What is it about?
	
The Quark-Puzzle is a visualisation and a teaching ais from the field particle physics which guarantees an inductive approach of principles of hadron physics. Pupils/students/people interested in hadron physics can learn about basic principles of the strong interaction and the Standard Model of particle physics by experimentally and playfully building up hadrons from quarks.

Only colour-neutral hadrons can be built. Furthermore, it is not possible to build hadrons that have a top flavour. It is intended that pupils develop their own questions and cognitive conflicts regarding the role of the top quark in the Standard Model, colour-neutrality of hadrons, the electrical charge of the built systems, the difference between two-quark and three-quark systems and quark generations.

Content and description

The Quark-Puzzle consists of 36 different pieces (quarks), which can be 3d-printed in the six quark-flavours up, down, strange, charm, top, bottom and in their antiparticles. The flavour is symbolised on an outer side (see pictures).
Due to the charge of the strong interaction - colour charges - all quarks are present in the three versions, which should be printed in the respective colours/anticolours (red, blue, green for matter; anti-red (cyan), anti-green (pink) and anti-blue (yellow) for antimatter) if possible. Additionally, the colour charge is engraved on the inside of the quark shape. 

The plug-in mechanism is selected so that only colour-neutral hadrons can be built, which means that the following combinations are possible:

		
  - Red--Blue--Green 			(Baryon)
		
  - Anti-red--anti-blue--anti-green 	(Anti-Baryon)
	
  - Anti-red--red 			(Meson)
	
  - Anti-blue--blue 			(Meson)
	
  - Anti-green--green 			(Meson)

The binding mechanism only dependent on the colour. Since the formation time of hadrons with top flavour is longer than its lifetime, they have not yet been observed. This is considered in the puzzle, since top quarks do not have contacts and thus cannot be built up into hadrons. On the upper side of a quark there is information about the quark generation (circle: first generation; tetrahedron: second generation; square: third generation). The electric charge of a quark is imprinted in another side of the shape.

How do I print the puzzle pieces?

You only need a 3D printer. We have provided each particle individually and as a colour composition (without top quarks, as we assume fewer are needed). Import the files as STL into your manufacturer programme. The quarks have a large resolution so that the programme automatically reduces the size.
It is important to note that you reduce the particles relatively and NOT absolutely to the same size! The parts have slightly different sizes.		
Because there are minor errors in each print result, we have taken this into account in the design. Prints with size of the long side up to 50mm (= diameter of the target object, dodecahedron) give very good results. For prints larger than 50mm the particles do not hold together perfectly. A version for this is planned.
In our experience, it is advisable to place the side with the flavour, flat on the gound of your manufacturer's programme, this has already been done in the composition.  

I would like to make changes to the design, is that possible?

No, we don't want that and have therefore excluded it in the licence (CC BY-ND). If you have a need for improvement or suggestions, or if you see that someone is changing the product, we would be happy to receive an email: quarks@mageta.de.

I would like to share the files - which I downloaded in the original and did not change - is that possible?

Yes, of course you can, just make sure you mention the name (CC BY-ND). The product is freely available and should please as many people interested in physics as possible!

Which programmes were used, which printer?

Abaqus, TinkerCAD and FreeCAD were used for the construction, successful prints on a 3D printer from Prusa 

Notes for teachers:

In events where pupils have already built hadrons with the puzzle, the wish was expressed to know the names of the particles. Adam Morris [1] programmed a Hadron Namer, which is available at the following address: https://hadron-names.web.cern.ch/. Note that tetraquarks and pentaquarks are also included, which cannot be built with the puzzle.
We have had good experiences with giving the pupils time to find out the symmetries (e.g. colour neutrality, el. charges, Mesons and Baryons, generations, role of the top quark) themselves and that pupil generate their own hypothesis and conceptualisation (experimental learning). An initial impulse which is given in advance (e.g. that hadrons are colour neutral) can accelerate the process. Classical instruction lends itself to reflection afterwards to systemise knowledge.

Who are "we"

The Quark Puzzle was developed by Lukas Julian Exner and Sebastian Neubert (LHCb Bonn) at the Helmholtz Institute for Radiation and Nuclear Physics at the University of Bonn.
